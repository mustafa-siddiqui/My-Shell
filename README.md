# My-Shell
A simple, basic shell.

#### Notes:  
Currently supports arguments only separated by whitespaces.

#### TBD:  
Incorporate generic linked list implementation to store arguments and consequently support statements like 'PartOne\ PartTwo' to be one argument.

#### Try it out :) ⬇️
`clone` this repo and simply run `make` to compile. To run: `./msh`.  
=> **MUST** be invoked from the directory in which the makefile resides <=  
*(or add /Shell dir to include path)*
