# My-Shell
A simple, basic shell.

#### Notes:  
Currently supports three built-in commands:  
* cd (change dir)
* help (info about cmds)
* exit (to exit the shell program)
Other shell programs/cmds like vim, ls are run as processes.

Currently supports arguments separated by whitespaces only.

#### TBD:  
Incorporate generic linked list implementation to store arguments and consequently support statements like 'PartOne\ PartTwo' to be one argument.

#### Try it out :) ⬇️
`clone` this repo and simply run `make` to compile. To run: `./msh`.  
=> **MUST** be invoked from the directory in which the makefile resides <=  
*(or add /Shell dir to include path)*
